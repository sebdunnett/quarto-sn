  Attention all citizens: this is an ecological emergency. The health and stability of our planet's ecosystems are rapidly deteriorating, and immediate action is required to address this crisis. Climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution are some of the major factors contributing to the decline of our planet's health.
  
  The consequences of inaction are dire. Rising temperatures, natural disasters, and food and water scarcity will have devastating effects on communities around the world. We are already witnessing the effects of this crisis, from raging wildfires to devastating hurricanes.
  
  The time for action is now. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, protect and restore ecosystems, and reduce waste and pollution. We can make changes in our own lives by reducing our carbon footprint, conserving resources, and supporting environmentally friendly practices and policies.
  
  Let's work together to create a better future for ourselves, our children, and generations to come. Let's protect the planet and all its species, before it's too late. This is not just an environmental issue, it's a humanitarian one. The health of the planet is our health, and we must act now to save it.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}
## ChatGPT, what are the basics of markdown? {#sec-md-basics}

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It is designed to be simple and easy to read, and it uses a set of characters and symbols to indicate formatting such as headings, lists, and emphasis. Some of the basics of Markdown include:

* Headings are indicated by the pound sign (#) followed by a space. The number of pound signs used indicates the level of the heading, with one pound sign indicating the highest level heading and six pound signs indicating the lowest level heading.

* Lists are created by using the dash (-) or asterisk (*) followed by a space for each list item.

* Emphasis can be indicated by using asterisks (*) or underscores (_) around a word or phrase. One asterisk or underscore is used for italic emphasis, and two asterisks or underscores are used for bold emphasis.

* Links can be added by using the brackets [] followed by the link text, then the brackets () followed by the link URL.

* Images can be added by using the exclamation mark ! followed by the brackets [] for the image's alternate text, then the brackets () followed by the image URL.

* Code blocks can be indicated by using three back-ticks (```) before and after the code snippet.

Markdown is a versatile and flexible language, and there are many more elements you can add, but these are the basics to get you started. Additionally, there are different flavors of markdown, so some elements may vary depending on the implementation.

# Discussion

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or Conclusion is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section Results and Discussion followed by a section Conclusion. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements [@ecology101].

# Conclusion

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations.

Hopefully.
