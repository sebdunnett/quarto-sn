# Discussion

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or Conclusion is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section Results and Discussion followed by a section Conclusion. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements [@bib1;@bib2].

# Conclusion

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations.
